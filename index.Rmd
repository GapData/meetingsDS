# Overview {-}

This site attempts to list data science events and groups. Please 
feel free to add any missing group or conference. 

To propose a change, just click the pencil icon in the top left hand corner.

We also maintain a separate list of [R events and meetups](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/).



### Technical bit {-}

The html files for this document live in the `docs/` directory of the [repository](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsDS/). Travis
creates the html files from the `.Rmd` files and commits them to the `docs/` directory.
